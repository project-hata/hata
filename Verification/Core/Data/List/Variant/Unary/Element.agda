-- | Having defined lists, we want to speak about elements
--   of lists, that is, we want a proposition |as ‚àç a|,
--   that the list |as| contains the element |a|.
--   In fact, since lists might contain the same element
--   at multiple positions, it is useful to include this information
--   and have |as ‚àç a| not be a mere proposition, but to be the
--   set of all occurences of |a| inside of |as|.

-- [Definition]
-- | Let [..] be a type.
module _ {A : ùí∞ ùëñ} where

  -- |> The data type [..] is inhabited by elements
  --   describing the occurrences of |a| in |as|.
  data _‚àç‚ôÆ_ : List A -> A -> ùí∞ ùëñ where

  -- |> It is defined using two constructors

  -- | - Given any list |bs|, we can conclude that
  --     the list |a ‚à∑ bs| contains the element |a|.
    incl : ‚àÄ{a bs} -> (a ‚à∑ bs) ‚àç‚ôÆ a

  -- | - Furthermore, if we know that some list |bs|
  --     already contains |a|, then after prepending any
  --     element |b| to that list, it still contains |a|.
    skip : ‚àÄ{a b bs} -> bs ‚àç‚ôÆ a -> (b ‚à∑ bs) ‚àç‚ôÆ a

  -- |: Thus, every occurence of |a| in |as| corresponds
  --    to a proof |as ‚àç‚ôÆ a|, given by a sequence of |skip|
  --    constructors followed by |incl| when that occurence is reached.

-- #Notation/Rewrite# ‚àç‚ôÆ = ‚àç
