-- ===* Theories


-- | The purpose of this /theory of theories/ is to explicitly describe a framework in
-- which all efforts in the area of syntax and semantics of type theories and programming languages
-- can be located. We want to include everything one would intuitively expect to be part of such research.
-- Thus we necessarily end up with a very rudimentary picture, based on a least common denominator.
-- Such a picture does not help with proving new theorems, and will not be surprising to anyone familiar
-- with the usual concepts and goals. In fact it should merely reflect this state of mind in a formal environment.

-- | We follow the common notion that a (type) theory may be viewed from the following perspectives:
-- | - /Type Theory/: A formal system with a set of terms and types, and a typing judgement relating them with each other.
-- | - /Category/: A set of objects, and sets of arrows between them, encoding the notion of composition.
-- | - /Computational Model/: A set of (possibly typed) terms with rewriting rules between them.


-- |: The "best" type theories (simple type theory, dependent type theory) incorporate all of these perspectives,
-- and this is known as /computational trilogy/. But our goal at the moment is not to describe the "best" type theories,
-- but to give a definition which subsumes anything which looks like a theory at all. Our attempt at describing the least common denominator
-- between the three perspectives is as follows:





-- #Notation/Rewrite# ■ᵘ = □
-- #Notation/Rewrite# ■ = □

-- #Notation/SemanticCategory# \mathbf{Mon} = Monoid
-- #Notation/Annotatable# assoc
